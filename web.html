    <h2>My Love Letter</h2>
    <p>
Hi, Baby!

This is the very first letter Im writing for you, and honestly, words still fall short on how grateful I am to have found you. You walked into my life without a warning, and somehow, that became the best thing ever that happened to me. Its like discovering a part of me I never realized was missing, until you showed up and completed and a space in me I didn't even know was empty.

Ive never been certain about anything in life. Every little decisions comes with hesitations. But the moment I met you, everything just settled. No doubts. No confusion. My heart, for once, just knew and and it never had second thoughts. I think I made it pretty obvious when you asked, "Are we dating?" and I instantly said yes without a hint of hesitation. Loving you wasnt a choice I had to make; my soul just found its home.

Even when were 10 000km and 6 time zones apart, your love still managed to find its way to me and I carry that with me every single day. Because of your deep love, I've started to see myself through your eyes, my favorite eyes in the world. 

You've given me a love that is patient, kind, and understanding and that means a lot to me. I love you more than these three words can ever fully express baby. And ill keep loving you always in all ways I know how, through every version and phases of you. 

I want to grow with you, learn through our mistakes, get old with you and face every highs and lows side by side. I want to spend my lifetime not just staring at you but really seeing you.

Forever yours,  
Jes
    </p>
